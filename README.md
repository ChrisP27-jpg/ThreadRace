# ThreadRace

This is my first time working with threads. The idea behind this is to create a race condition among these threads. In total, 2 threads are created, but it is undeterministic as to when the second thread will begin todo the calculations.

## Usage

:$ make

:$ ./pt-task "number of times to run" "string to print out EX: 'hello!'"
